//! [`Blocker`]: one thing in a Painter project that MaterialCraft can't evaluate yet, with a stable key.
//!
//! Every part of a layer that isn't computable names its blocker, so an import can say exactly what keeps each
//! layer locked, a corpus can be ranked by what blocks the most (`mcsub blockers`), and a locked layer knows which
//! keys would unlock it once support for them is added (an importer's own support catalog decides which can be). The key is stable across imports and
//! projects; the text is for people and keeps the role it was met in (a mask generator, a procedural fill …).
//!
//! | Kind | Key | What blocks |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`BlockerKind::Substance`] | `substance:<graph>` | a compiled Substance graph (generator, procedural fill or texture, filter) |
//! | [`BlockerKind::BrushAlpha`] | `brush-alpha:<name>` | strokes painted with a brush alpha we don't have |
//! | [`BlockerKind::Brush`] | `brush:<what>` | strokes our brush can't paint: particles, 3D paths, stencils, projection … |
//! | [`BlockerKind::Strokes`] | `strokes:<what>` | strokes that were not replayed (stroke replay is off) |
//! | [`BlockerKind::Feature`] | `feature:<id>` | a Painter feature the import doesn't model yet |
//! | [`BlockerKind::Class`] | `class:<class>` | a layer, effect or source class the reader doesn't know |
